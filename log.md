# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Started new ZF3 CMS project.
* Created skeleton application.
* Setup entities and database SQL.
* Added doctrine ORM dependency.

**Thoughts:** Took a little while to get back into Zend Framework. This is my first ZF3 application. ZF3 seems fairly similar to ZF2. The
main difference I've found so far is that you no longer have the service locator inside the controller. Instead you use dependency injection
to insert the dependencies required.
